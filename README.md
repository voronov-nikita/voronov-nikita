## **About**
Every day when I sit down at my computer, I ask myself what I want to do in the future. It is clear that this will be connected with the world of IT technologies, but there are very, very many options. The choice is so big that your eyes just run away. And even if we consider all the substructures of the IT world, it turns out that there are branches there too. For example, the profession of an application developer is divided into a developer of web applications, desktop applications and mobile developers. In my opinion, too much, so I decided to try myself in everything. Of course, I probably won't be able to try myself everywhere, but I will already have a lot of experience in many areas of the IT world.

## **My Progress**
Now I have only a year left until I graduate from my school, but I hope to be in time in many things. Over the past year, I have managed to try myself in web development ([my-sait](https://github.com/voronov-nikita/my-sait)), desktop application development ([python_spamer](https://github.com/voronov-nikita/python_spamer), [individual-project-2022_2023](https://github.com/voronov-nikita/individual-project-2022_2023)). Also this year I tried myself in robot programming, a little in mobile development and worked with the Arduino microcontroller ([Arduino-mini-Projects](https://github.com/voronov-nikita/Arduino-mini-Projects)) and the Raspberry pi microcomputer ([greenhouse-model](https://github.com/voronov-nikita/greenhouse-model)). I also managed to try myself in creating a Telegram bot ([Telegram-bot](https://github.com/voronov-nikita/Telegram-bot)).
